> Don't you think that we should take our COVID-19 innovation further?

I was quite taken aback when [Jing Fang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jing-fang-ong-725a6a123/) asked me this question in end-2021. You see, just several months back, Singapore was in the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic. Borders were closed and travel was unfathomable. The key obstacle preventing the safe reopening of travel was the implementation of tamper-proof vaccine certificates to enforce safe travel.

Back then, Jing Fang, [Dr Tan Hwee Jia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hwee-jia-tan-791a7395/) and I were part of a special projects team looking into how to design a digital solution that was interoperable across borders; negotiate for multilateral adoption with our neighbours; and ensure that border operations could scale. Coordination was a wicked problem â€“ I remember having to speak to no fewer than eight government agencies, countless international counterparts and their airline companies, and countless private clinics across Singapore, all with varying digital capabilities.

Blockchain solutions provided an excellent product-market fit then. Together with the software engineers from GovTech, we designed a novel solution called [Healthcerts](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health-records-go-digital-to-fight-fakes-restart-air-travel), where the government essentially minted a hash of healthcare records against the blockchain. When the hash was retrieved from the blockchain, this allowed anyone in the world to independently verify that the healthcare record in question was indeed issued by a recognised healthcare authority in Singapore.

But we were moving into 2022, with COVID-19 to be declared an endemic disease. Surely there was no more need for Healthcerts in future?

> Jing Fang, are you referring to Healthcerts? I'm not sure for how long this technology will be required. Seems to me that it was a product fit for its time, but...

> No, I'm not referring to Healthcerts. I'm talking about this whole idea of decentralisation - that's what you're really excited about right? Who cares if we still use Healthcerts or not!
