> The Sense product team was interviewed by [Siying](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siyingthian/) from GovInsider, and we made the headlines today! Check out the main article [here](https://govinsider.asia/intl-en/article/govtech-launches-llm-for-data-driven-policymaking-in-singapore-public-sector), which has summarised the key messages that our team wishes to put across to the public service.
>
> In this blog post, I wish to elaborate a little bit more on these key messages, which I hope will be taken seriously by any budding product manager in the public service when developing applications for government agencies. We have partnered so many agencies over the past few months, be it developing Sense or change managing business processes. It would most definitely be a remiss on our part if we did not leave behind a legacy of experience for our fellow tech sector colleagues.

> For those who are still pursuing meaningful change in the public service, be it tech or otherwise, we hope articles like this will be a small beacon to keep your eyes on the prize of innovation.

## Product management is not just finding a good use case and the successful delivery of a good working product. It calls for a product vision, team culture, business strategy, organisational change management and an intimate understanding of the business that you're building for.

When I first took on the product manager role in January this year, I had assumed that one of my key responsibilities was to just find a good use case. *Find a good product-market fit!* After all, that's what they teach you in all basic product management courses - start with a good problem statement that everyone's itching to solve, and the business will naturally come. I also thought it was about just building a good product. *Build it and they will come!* Surely if there's a product that meets user needs, and I build it, we'll naturally get our business going? What other secret sauces of success would we possibly require, other than the product itself?

I quickly discovered that having a good piece of work doesn't necessarily speak for itself. TransformGovSG took only 1 month to develop a good working version of Sense, but we were nowhere near getting adoption. No one was flocking towards us to use our product.

What did we do wrong? We found a good use case, and we built a good product. Why weren't people coming?

We did tonnes wrong. And we would do things differently a thousand times over, if we were called to the same stage again.
