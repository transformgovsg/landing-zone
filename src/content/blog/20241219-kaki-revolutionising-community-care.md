Care in a community takes a community. Yet, in the community sector, care often feels fragmented. Many parties — from different roles, organizations, and sectors — come together to care for a resident. But disconnection makes coordination difficult and prevents providers from seeing the full picture of a resident’s health.

Residents themselves often end up being the central contact point, shuttling information between providers. With so much information and so many questions, this process can quickly become overwhelming.

Enter Kaki, a game-changing app that simplifies care coordination and information sharing. Built by government agencies, Kaki combines the functions of a chat app and a file manager into one seamless platform designed for both residents and care providers.

## Simplifying Connections
With Kaki, residents and providers can connect directly. Providers can search for residents under their care, enabling instant communication and easy sharing of important information.

Imagine this scenario: You’re a rehab therapist wrapping up a session with Mr. Tan. You want him to take home the care goals you’ve set together so he can review them before the next session. Simply search for Mr. Tan on Kaki, and select the files you want to send — whether it’s a Word document, PDF, or picture. Just drag and drop. No need for manual notes or paper printouts.

## A Comprehensive Toolkit for Care
Kaki enables providers to share everything from rehab goals and exercise photos to caregiver training videos and patient education materials. You can also send scans, reports, memos, or any other information crucial to care. Best of all, this information is instantly accessible on any device, making it as easy as texting a family member.

And while convenience is a priority, so is security. Kaki is built with security at its core, giving users peace of mind.

## Keeping Everyone in the Loop
Care is rarely a solo endeavor. With Kaki, caregivers can be added to group chats alongside providers, ensuring that everyone stays informed. Select family members or caregivers to join the conversation, and just like that, they’re in! No more missed updates or confusion.

The benefits don’t stop there. Providers can also collaborate in group chats, bridging communication gaps and streamlining coordination. Whether you’re at home, in the hospital, or at a care center, your information is always with you — right in your back pocket.

## Organized and Personalized Care
Finding specific reports or care goals has never been easier. Kaki’s intuitive filters help you locate files quickly, neatly sorting them for hassle-free access. Need that care plan from last week? Just filter, find, and it’s there.

Kaki also recognizes the diverse and individual needs of its users. With its profile feature, you can create a unique care profile. Input details about the support you need once, and it’s instantly accessible to all your providers. This eliminates repetitive explanations and ensures everyone has the information they need to provide the best care possible.

## Revolutionizing Care for Everyone
Kaki transforms care by making it relational and personalized. It simplifies communication, organizes critical information, and connects care communities like never before.

With Kaki, care becomes seamless and empowering, giving providers a complete picture and making life easier for residents and their families.

Chat, share, and stay organized with Kaki. Together, we’re simplifying care for everyone.
