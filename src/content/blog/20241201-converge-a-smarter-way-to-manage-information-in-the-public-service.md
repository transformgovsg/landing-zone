## What is Converge?
Converge is a cutting-edge solution tailored for public service professionals who need to extract, synthesize, and utilize critical information efficiently. Designed with public officers in mind, Converge bridges the gap between scattered data and actionable insights, helping you focus on what truly matters—making informed decisions.

In this post, we’ll walk through the standout features of Converge and showcase how it transforms tedious tasks into seamless processes.

## Three Core Features of Converge
1. Information Retrieval and Synthesis
Converge connects directly with your uploaded documents and SharePoint folders, enabling you to search through vast amounts of data in seconds. It retrieves and synthesizes key information, presenting it in a clear and concise format. Whether it’s five documents or five hundred, Converge scales effortlessly—your only limitation is your SharePoint storage.

2. Automated Drafting for Speeches and Press Releases
Need to draft a speech or press release? Converge can write up to 75% of your content based on uploaded outlines, meeting minutes, or email exchanges. It even includes references, ensuring traceability and accuracy.

3. Calendar and Email Integration
Converge integrates seamlessly with Outlook to retrieve emails and calendar events. This feature simplifies meeting scheduling, follow-ups, and information tracking, making your inbox and calendar much more manageable.

##  Feature in Action: Synthesizing Meeting Minutes
Let’s dive into a real-world scenario to see Converge in action. Imagine you’re a public officer tasked with creating a chronological timeline for a sensitive issue like a data breach.

Here’s how Converge can help:

### Step 1: Upload Meeting Minutes
We uploaded five months of meeting minutes into a SharePoint folder. Converge scanned these documents in seconds.

### Step 2: Ask Key Questions
We asked Converge:

> When was the data breach first discovered?
> Who identified it?

Converge instantly provided the answer:

> The data breach was discovered by Kevin Ng on 18 March 2024.

Citations accompanied the response, showing exactly which document and excerpt supported the information.

### Step 3: Dig Deeper
Next, we asked:

> How was the data breach discovered?
> 
Converge retrieved detailed insights into the mechanics behind the incident, including technical specifics documented in the minutes.

### Step 4: Uncover Root Causes and Implications
Finally, we explored:

> Why did the data breach occur?
> What were the implications?

Converge synthesized the root cause and outlined the extent of the breach, making it easier to communicate findings and plan responses.

## Tracking Decisions and Action Items
One of Converge’s standout capabilities is its ability to track decisions and follow-ups. For example:

- If you need to audit key decisions across multiple meetings, Converge can retrieve them all.
- If you’re focusing on a specific topic, such as decisions related to a data breach, Converge can filter results accordingly.

This feature ensures nothing slips through the cracks, helping teams stay accountable and organized.

## After-Action Reviews Made Easy
Conducting an after-action review (AAR) is another common task where Converge shines. After an incident is reviewed, Converge synthesizes key lessons learned. For example, when asked to summarize the April meeting’s AAR, Converge pulled together all relevant points and presented them in a cohesive narrative.

## Empowering Public Officers
At its core, Converge is more than a tool—it’s a personal companion for public service officers. By handling the heavy lifting of information retrieval, synthesis, and drafting, it allows officers to focus on strategic decision-making and impactful work.

Converge’s ability to:

- Connect with SharePoint, Outlook, and other tools,
- Retrieve precise information with citations, and
- Draft content based on real data,

ensures it meets the unique demands of the public sector.
