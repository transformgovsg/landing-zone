## Foreword
> 2024 has been a transformative year, not just in the accomplishments weâ€™ve achieved, but in the journeys weâ€™ve embarked upon as individuals and as a team. Reflections are key in reminding the team to constantly take on challenges outside of one's comfort zone and to continuously build a legacy of collaboration and impact.
> 
> As we look ahead to 2025, this piece serves as an inspiring reminder of the power of purpose-driven innovation and the importance of succession in sustaining momentum. We hope our reflections also inspire you to pause, take stock of your own breakthroughs, and envision what lies ahead.
> 
> Hereâ€™s to another year of trying new things and making a difference.

In 2024, Iâ€™m glad to have achieved the following:

- **Approval from various Senior Management (GovTech, Ministry of Health, National Healthcare Group) to invest in a team of 15 developers and create a suite of 3 innovative products.** This was an opportunity to delve into meaningful problem statements and create useful and usable solutions that could be deployed at scale in the public service.

- **A successful transition of 15 developers from their previous projects into a new innovation squad, Transform.** I was glad for the opportunity to create their own work priorities, culture and products, and hope that this was an endeavour that enriched their personal growth.

- **To have played the role of product manager for Sense, a whole-of-government level application, as well as the role of Program Director for a suite of three innovative products created by the Transform team.** As a policy officer, I was entirely new to managing a product team at both product and program levels - I am grateful to the entire product team for being patient with my leadership.

In 2025, Iâ€™m looking forward to **firming up my succession plans**. As I leave for my post-graduate studies at UC Berkeley, I hope to set the team up for success and have them continue contributing to public service with the same spirit we set out to do so at the beginning of this year.

In 2024, Iâ€™m glad to have achieved the following:

- **Proud and excited to be able to launch Kaki in Dec 2024 as a team**! Embarked on a hopeful journey for Kaki from the day we started our Proof-of-Concept to the day we published it in Apple and Google app stores. I was happy to hear from our stakeholders, about their thoughts on the product - it was the first time in a while to be hearing feedback directly from users.

- **To have pick up React Native + GraphQL + various administrative know-how for a production-grade application** -  there are definitely still some shortcomings on the implementation and more things to improve on, but this entire learning journey is one of my biggest learnings, tech-wise, I had in 2024

- **To have played the role of Reporting Officer / Teach Lead for a product team**, where my biggest gift was to constantly receive feedbacks from my team mates. I felt very fortunate to be in a team who are very open to voice out their concerns and feedback, felt that we are helping each other to grow every day. ðŸ™‚

In 2025, I look forward to seeing **Kaki continue to be built and expanded on** (I trust that it will be in good hands even though we are no longer the developing team) and as a team we can build the next product that will be useful and well-loved by our users.

In 2024, Iâ€™m glad to have achieved the following:

- **Successfully launched Kaki together with the team**, even though I joined the team blind not knowing how much my skill sets could help given that I was not a full-fledged Software Engineer, and how much my Quality Engineer skillsets could come into play. Thankfully, everything worked out and despite the really short runway, we managed to come up with something that we can be proud to say that has tons of potential for social- and healthcare sectors!

- **Managed to hone a secondary skillset in DevOps and Cloud infrastructure**, and even able to spin up an entire environment on my own with some guidance from our DevOps Master Chadin. Prior to working on Kaki, I had not touched AWS and even IAC as much before but doing this has given me newfound respect and appreciation for DevOps engineers past and present that I worked with. Not an easy feat I would say!

- **Had a lot of fun and joy** working with everyone in the team!

Come 2025, I'm excited for some of the new things to come in our new agency deployment! Although unknowns still remain, I am glad that we can move on together as a team and go through new challenges together.
