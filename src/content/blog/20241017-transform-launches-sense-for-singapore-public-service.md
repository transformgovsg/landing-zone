> Alex and I had very little in common. I was a policy officer, and Alex was a software engineer - we couldn't have come from more different backgrounds and disciplines. But somehow, we would always spend a significant portion of our time at work discussing how to make things in government better. It was rare to find someone who cared about problems with a passion.
>
> Before we started TransformGovSG, Alex and I had a different dream - to transform the way government grant portals work. Quite poetically, the TransformGovSG team and us pioneered an early concept of how we could potentially collapse all four government grant portals and policy processes onto a single digital platform. We spent a huge amount of time and energies engaging various government stakeholders at various forums, and performing various technical experiments.
>
> Our goal was to create a single re-useable platform that could not only act as a grant application portal, but also as a portal for all application-based policies in Singapore. We envisioned huge cost and manpower savings, and the potential to re-deploy our engineers for other innovation projects elsewhere in government.
> 
> Today, our ambition has been succeeded by the current Business Grants Portal team, and they have taken our idea further into implementation.
>
> So this is a tribute to where the idea first began, and is part of us seeking closure from our previous portfolio as we look to the next bound in our public service tech journey.
