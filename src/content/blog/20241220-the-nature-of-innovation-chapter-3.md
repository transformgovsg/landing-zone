> Don't you think that we should take our COVID-19 innovation further?

I was quite taken aback when Jing Fang asked me this question in end-2021. You see, just several months back, Singapore was in the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic. Borders were closed and travel was unfathomable. The key obstacle preventing the safe reopening of travel was the implementation of tamper-proof vaccine certificates to enforce safe travel.

Back then, Jing Fang, Dr Tan Hwee Jia and I were part of a special projects team looking into how to design a digital solution that was interoperable across borders; negotiate for multilateral adoption with our neighbours; and ensure that border operations could scale. Coordination was a wicked problem â€“ I remember having to speak to no fewer than eight government agencies, countless international counterparts and their airline companies, and countless private clinics across Singapore, all with varying digital capabilities.

Blockchain solutions provided an excellent product-market fit. But I knew immediately that a single officer from the Ministry of Health was insufficient to move the mountain of change management across Singapore and our borders. I wrote with eager anticipation to our border security, air transport, healthcare regulation and government technology agencies and offered them a glimpse of my vision for reopening travel.
