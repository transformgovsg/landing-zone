> The Sense product team was recently interviewed by GovInsider (courtesy of [Thian Siying](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siyingthian/), and we made the headlines today! Check out the main article [here](https://govinsider.asia/intl-en/article/govtech-launches-llm-for-data-driven-policymaking-in-singapore-public-sector), which has summarised the key messages that our team wishes to put across to the public service.

> In this blog post, I wish to elaborate a little bit more on these key messages, which I hope will be taken seriously by any budding product manager in the public service when developing applications for government agencies. We have partnered so many agencies over the past few months, be it developing Sense or change managing business processes. It would most definitely be a remiss on our part if we did not leave behind a legacy of experience for our fellow tech sector colleagues.

> For those who are still pursuing meaningful change in the public service, be it tech or otherwise, we hope articles like this will be a small beacon to keep your eyes on the prize of innovation.

## Product management is not just finding a good use case and the successful delivery of a good working product. It calls for a product vision, team culture, business strategy, organisational change management and an intimate understanding of the business that you're building for.

When I first took on the product manager role in January this year, I had assumed that one of my key responsibilities was to just find a good use case. *Find a good product-market fit!* After all, that's what they teach you in all basic product management courses - start with a good problem statement that everyone's itching to solve, and the business will naturally come. 

I also thought it was about just building a good product. *Build it and they will come!* Surely if there's a product that meets user needs, and I build it, we'll naturally get our business going? What other secret sauces of success would we possibly require, other than the product itself?

I quickly discovered that having a good piece of work doesn't necessarily speak for itself. TransformGovSG took only 1 month to develop a good working version of Sense, but we were nowhere near getting adoption. No one was flocking towards us to 
use our product.

What did we do wrong? We found a good use case, we built a good product, and we were also government-building-for-government. Why weren't people coming?

Well, we did tonnes wrong. And we would do things differently a thousand times over, if we were called to the same stage again.

## If you want to scale, you should never meet all your customer's needs. But if you are talking about first adoption in a niche, your first customer is king.

One of the golden rules in product management is to figure out your unique selling point, rather than pander to all the requirements put forth by your customer base. The rationale is simple: you don't want to spend too much effort creating and sustaining demand, otherwise it's impossible to scale quickly and expand your product lines.

Many entrepreneuers subscribe to this rule - in fact Daniel Priestley himself advocates the need to "position your products and services as unique and valuable in the marketplace", rather than creating something that is overly generic. That is the reason why most start-ups never try to serve entire markets, but seek out niche verticals to start their products in.

But when you've found your niche vertical, and in particular your first customer within this small market slice, that's about when you ought to adopt a fierce customer-centric mindset, which literally could look like you're giving everything they want. Your first customer is key, and forms the archetype of who you'll be coming to serve for a considerable time ahead. In fact, the choice of your first customer is also important - having a reputable first customer serves as a testimonial, enhancing the product's credibility and making it more attractive to potential buyers.

You need to go to the extent of literally developing your product hand-in-hand with this first customer, and treating them as part of your development team or even providing a special first service. It's going to feel as if you're giving into customer demands entirely, but that's where the product manager must make an expert call to balance between what the product vision calls for, and what the first customer is asking for.

> When I worked at Circles Life, I remember how the head of engineering team went to meet one of the first few customers of circle life and gave him onsite service at a mrt station. This was clearly over-servicing, and we did it only for our first few customers, because we knew that working so closely with these few early customers would help us shape the product better and get us the advocacy we needed.

In our case, it's quite clear why we chose the Ministry of Health (MOH)




## It's fine to have a grand market vision. But you must always start by creating virtuous cycles.

## You probably want to build everything yourself. But always see if you can borrow rather than build.

## Your product may well have started out from a certain use case. But you should always seek to expand that use case into an system-level problem statement.
