## Yeo Yong Kiat

In 2024, I’m glad to have achieved the following:

- **Approval from various Senior Management (GovTech, Ministry of Health, National Healthcare Group) to invest in a team of 15 developers and create a suite of 3 innovative products.** This was an opportunity to delve into meaningful problem statements and create useful and usable solutions that could be deployed at scale in the public service.

- **A successful transition of 15 developers from their previous projects into a new innovation squad, Transform.** I was glad for the opportunity to create their own work priorities, culture and products, and hope that this was an endeavour that enriched their personal growth.

- **To have played the role of product manager for Sense, a whole-of-government level application, as well as the role of Program Director for a suite of three innovative products created by the Transform team.** As a policy officer, I was entirely new to managing a product team at both product and program levels - I am grateful to the entire product team for being patient with my leadership.

In 2025, I’m looking forward to **firming up my succession plans**. As I leave for my post-graduate studies at UC Berkeley, I hope to set the team up for success and have them continue contributing to public service with the same spirit we set out to do so at the beginning of this year.
