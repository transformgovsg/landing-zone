> Don't you think that we should take our COVID-19 innovation further?

I was quite taken aback when [Jing Fang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jing-fang-ong-725a6a123/) asked me this question in end-2021. You see, just several months back, Singapore was in the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic. Borders were closed and travel was unfathomable. The key obstacle preventing the safe reopening of travel was the implementation of tamper-proof vaccine certificates to enforce safe travel.

Back then, Jing Fang, [Dr Tan Hwee Jia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hwee-jia-tan-791a7395/) and I were part of a special projects team looking into how to design a digital solution that was interoperable across borders; negotiate for multilateral adoption with our neighbours; and ensure that border operations could scale. Coordination was a wicked problem â€“ I remember having to speak to no fewer than eight government agencies, countless international counterparts and their airline companies, and countless private clinics across Singapore, all with varying digital capabilities.

Blockchain solutions provided an excellent product-market fit then. Together with the software engineers from GovTech, we designed a novel solution called [Healthcerts](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health-records-go-digital-to-fight-fakes-restart-air-travel), where the government essentially minted a hash of healthcare records against the blockchain. When the hash was retrieved from the blockchain, this allowed anyone in the world to independently verify that the healthcare record in question was indeed issued by a recognised healthcare authority in Singapore.

But we were moving into 2022, with COVID-19 to be declared an endemic disease. Surely there was no more need for Healthcerts in future?

> Jing Fang, are you referring to Healthcerts? I'm not sure for how long this technology will be required. Seems to me that it was a product fit for its time, but...

> No, I'm not referring to Healthcerts. I'm talking about this whole idea of decentralisation - that's what you're really excited about right? Who cares if we still use Healthcerts or not!

Well she got one thing right. I was truly excited about the concept of Web 3.0 - not so much cryptocurrency and blockchains, but the whole idea that we could own our personal credentials on our personal devices, where issuance and verification of such credentials could be decentralised. It was my "public service" dream of sorts. I had been serving in the education and healthcare sectors for 7 years, and public service globally had generally relied on building expensive and large centralised IT systems to manage credentials of all sorts.

But what if we re-imagined residents owning their own credentials? Suppose we suspend any doubts on how this was technically possible (or whether we wanted to place this burden on residents), wouldn't this solve the age old problem of care coordination? You see, when we visit social- or healthcare providers, in order for them to craft a care plan for us or advise us on follow-ups, they require a myriad of personal care data from us. Healthcare by itself was pretty solid, with the National Electronic Health Records acting as a single source of truth - but the real problem came if there were care providers who did not have access to the NEHR. It would then be an endless cycle of back-and-forth between various providers to obtain the necessary information.

And trust me, I don't think building another centralised IT system for non-healthcare providers is a good solution. Imagine the coordination and bespoke engineering required - it would most definitely result in failure.

But now imagine a resident owning his own socio-healthcare records, just like how he owned his own COVID-19 vaccine certificate. He could bring this from provider to provider and act as his own mini source of truth! We wouldn't have to build any complex centralised IT system to link up the thousands of providers across the socio-healthcare spectrum.

Heck. We could save millions of dollars, and maybe even hundreds of coordination hours.
